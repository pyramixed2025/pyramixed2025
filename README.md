## What is Pyramixed?

Pyramixed takes the concept of musical mashups and boils it down to its core, making it accessible to everyone. At its heart, the game presents you with a pyramid of sound samples, each representing a different musical element like vocals, basslines, melodies, and drums. Your mission? To activate or deactivate these layers, experimenting with different combinations until you find the perfect blend – or, more likely, a surprisingly compelling sonic chaos.

The beauty of Pyramixed lies in its simplicity. There are no wrong answers, no complicated controls, just the freedom to explore the interplay of different musical components. It's a playful sandbox where you can discover unexpected harmonies, create surprising rhythms, and uncover your inner remixing genius. It’s a platform where accidents can often lead to the most creative and captivating results.
